# Task_Manager_2.0

Hello! I'm **Piotrek Szkopiak** and this is my training project to improve my skills for `Python` programming language.

### Overview

In this project I focused on _modifying_ famous 'to do list' from tutorials to _create upgraded version_.
I will implement features which increase protection, using `try - except` statement, from incorrect data input during program use and more complex (for me of course) operation like:

> - [x] Transfering 1 item between lists.
> - [x] Transfering all items between lists.
> - [x] Loading and saving tasks in external files.
   
I mostly built this project on `functions`, `while True` and `for` loops with statements.
